Problem 1:
Austo Motor Company is a leading car manufacturer specializing in SUV, Sedan, and Hatchback models. In its recent board meeting, the members raised concerns about the efficiency of the marketing campaign currently being used. The board decides to rope in an analytics professional to improve the existing campaign.

As an analyst hired by the company, you have been tasked with performing a thorough analysis of the data and coming up with insights to improve the marketing campaign.

2.1 What is the probability that a randomly chosen player would suffer an injury?

2.2 What is the probability that a player is a forward or a winger?

2.3 What is the probability that a randomly chosen player plays in a striker position and has a foot injury?

2.4 What is the probability that a randomly chosen injured player is a striker?

2.5 What is the probability that a randomly chosen injured player is either a forward or an attacking midfielder?  

Problem 3:
An independent research organization is trying to estimate the probability that an accident at a nuclear power plant will result in radiation leakage. The types of accidents possible at the plant are, fire hazards, mechanical failure, or human error. The research organization also knows that two or more types of accidents cannot occur simultaneously.

According to the studies carried out by the organization, the probability of a radiation leak in case of a fire is 20%, the probability of a radiation leak in case of a mechanical 50%, and the probability of a radiation leak in case of a human error is 10%. The studies also showed the following;

The probability of a radiation leak occurring simultaneously with a fire is 0.1%.
The probability of a radiation leak occurring simultaneously with a mechanical failure is 0.15%.
The probability of a radiation leak occurring simultaneously with a human error is 0.12%.
On the basis of the information available, answer the questions below:

3.1 What are the probabilities of a fire, a mechanical failure, and a human error respectively?

3.2 What is the probability of a radiation leak?

3.3 Suppose there has been a radiation leak in the reactor for which the definite cause is not known. What is the probability that it has been caused by:

A Fire.
A Mechanical Failure.
A Human Error. 
Problem 4:
The breaking strength of gunny bags used for packaging cement is normally distributed with a mean of 5 kg per sq. centimeter and a standard deviation of 1.5 kg per sq. centimeter. The quality team of the cement company wants to know the following about the packaging material to better understand wastage or pilferage within the supply chain; Answer the questions below based on the given information; (Provide an appropriate visual representation of your answers, without which marks will be deducted) 

4.1 What proportion of the gunny bags have a breaking strength less than 3.17 kg per sq cm?

4.2 What proportion of the gunny bags have a breaking strength at least 3.6 kg per sq cm.?

4.3 What proportion of the gunny bags have a breaking strength between 5 and 5.5 kg per sq cm.?

4.4 What proportion of the gunny bags have a breaking strength NOT between 3 and 7.5 kg per sq cm.? 

Problem 5:
Grades of the final examination in a training course are found to be normally distributed, with a mean of 77 and a standard deviation of 8.5. Based on the given information answer the questions below. 

5.1 What is the probability that a randomly chosen student gets a grade below 85 on this exam?

5.2 What is the probability that a randomly selected student scores between 65 and 87?

5.3 What should be the passing cut-off so that 75% of the students clear the exam?
